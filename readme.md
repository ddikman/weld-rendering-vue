# weld-rendering-vue

This is an example of how to render a Widget Definition List (WeLD) in VueJS.

As it uses ES6 module imports to grab the definition JS you must run a small http server to host the index file such as the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) from NPM.

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```
